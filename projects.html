        I've been working on Theseus <a href="{% post_url 2017-02-17-theseus-robust-system-for-preserving %}">since early 2017</a>.
        The goal: To create a robust system for sharing and preserving
        research. The project was first conceived as a response to governmental
        attempts at censorship of climate change research.
        </p>

        <p>
        The system consists of two parts: The actual application described
        above - <b>Theseus</b> - and a distributed hash table (DHT) on top of
        which the application is built.
        </p>

        <p>
        The DHT is a very simple distributed database that the application uses
        to form peer-to-peer connections and share data.
        </p>

        <p>
        In theory, any number of DHT algorithms could be used, but I'm making a
        new one. The working name for it is <b>Theseus DHT</b>. The motivation
        for this extra effort is to try and improve on the state of the art for
        defending against certain categories of attack, particularly Sybil
        attacks.
        </p>

        <p>
        The implementation is not yet complete, but the theoretical results
        achieved so far (the best of which I'm still in the process of writing
        up) are striking.
        </p>

        <p>
        There's a lot about Theseus and Theseus DHT on my blog.
        <a href="/tags/theseus.html">Here's a list of those posts</a>.
        Bear in mind that not everything in them is up to date.

        These are a series of cryptography challenges written by the folks at
        Matasano Security (which I believe has since been absorbed by NCC
        Group). Sets 1 through 7 are available
        <a href="https://cryptopals.com">here</a>, and you can check out Set 8
        <a href="https://toadstyle.org/cryptopals/">here</a>. They start out
        easy enough, but the later sets have a few genuinely tricky problems
        hidden in them.
        </p>

        <p>
        You can check out my solutions
        <a href="https://github.com/wootfish/cryptopals">on Github</a>.
        I've worked through sets 1 through 7 and plan on taking on set 8 soon.

        Back in the day I was very into <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>
        (I think I'm still in the <a href="https://projecteuler.net/profile/wootfish.png">99.4th percentile or so</a>
        on there after half a decade of inactivity). I mention that because to
        me, a lot of what makes Project Euler fun can also be found in
        Cryptopals. It's a different and more interesting sort of programming,
        and it's just so satisfying when you get it right.

        I only take the time to write these about books I've really enjoyed;
        as a result, these posts are less about offering deep criticism or
        reviews and more about just trying to share some of what I like or find
        compelling in the books I feature.
