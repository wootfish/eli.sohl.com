Everyone knows MD4 is insecure. Modern attacks can find MD4 collisions almost
instantly. It's easy to forget that the algorithm stood up to a decade and a
half of cryptanalysis before Wang et al. broke it open in 2004.

Wang's attack was the first efficient collision attack on MD4 but not the last;
the efficiency of the attack and the clarity of its presentation were both
improved by later research. Nevertheless, Wang's attack has historical
significance, and it is included in [set 7 of the Cryptopals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/sets/7/challenges/55).

I've been working through Cryptopals lately and I found this to be, without a
doubt, the hardest and most engaging challenge in the first 7 sets.

The attack itself is hard to implement; it is also hard to figure out _what_
you're supposed to implement. That's why this post is broken up into two parts:
this one, which summarizes the attack's theoretic underpinnings, and a
forthcoming second part which details an efficient implementation in Python.

[The original paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F11426639_1.pdf)
gives a partial sketch of the attack, plus some example collisions to prove that
it works. To work out the details, you have to read between the lines of a
challenging paper which (for English speakers) is only available in translation.

Eventually I gave in and started searching for blog posts on the attack; the few
I found were not much help. These are written to be the posts I wish I'd found.
I had only meant to write one post, but it was getting pretty long so I decided
to break it up into two parts: this one, on the theory of the attack, followed
by a forthcoming second part detailing an efficient implementation of the attack
in Python.

They say you don't understand something until you can teach it, so these posts
are my way of proving to myself that I understand Wang's attack. I hope someone
finds them useful or at least interesting. If they aren't detailed enough for
you, come on out to Seattle and we'll go through it over beers, coffee, or your
beverage of choice.


## The Basic Idea

This attack is a _differential attack_, meaning we as attackers are trying to
find collisions between pairs of messages where the messages also share a fixed
difference.

Differential attacks commonly use `xor` difference, but in this attack we are
interested in arithmetic difference; that is to say, we want messages $$m, m'$$
such that $$H(m) = H(m')$$ and $$m' - m = D$$ for some fixed differential $$D$$.

This might sound like adding an unnecessary constraint -- and it is -- but it
gives us a powerful way of reframing the problem. This definition makes $$m'$$
fully dependent on $$m$$ and $$D$$, so for the attack to succeed it suffices
to identify a set of messages $$S$$ such that if $$m \in S$$ then
$$H(m) = H(m + D)$$ with high probability.

Wang's attack consists of a definition for one such differential $$D$$ and a
method for arriving at likely elements of the corresponding message set $$S$$.

The attack's supporting theory is centered around an analysis of how certain
differentials spread through MD4's internal state. Supported by a set of simple
collisions in the hash function's round functions, this analysis culminates in a
set of (nearly) sufficient conditions for differentials in different parts of
the message to "cancel each other out" like waves coming together and
destructively interfering.

The result of this analysis is a characterization of the message set $$S$$,
which is defined by a set of more than one hundred conditions on the hash
function's intermediate states. These together form a set of (almost)[^1]
sufficient conditions for membership in $$S$$. Out of these hundred-odd
conditions, the paper prescribes methods for ensuring that a couple of them are
met; we are left to figure out the rest on our own.

[^1]: Later research has determined that the set of conditions given by Wang et al. is in fact neither necessary nor sufficient. Their list of constraints is, however, only two entries short from sufficiency, and their attack is still many orders of magnitude more efficient than brute force.

The result, if we are successful, is that during MD4 computation, differences in
the messages' hashes' intermediate states will be introduced and erased -- that
is, the states will be made to diverge and then reconverge -- giving rise to
collisions.

Before expanding on that idea, let's review the relevant parts of MD4 itself.


## The Structure of MD4 (in brief)

MD4 has a 128-bit internal state. Internally, this is represented as four 32-bit
state variables. Call them $$a, b, c, d$$. These are initialized to certain
fixed values. We'll call those $$a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0$$.

MD4 takes 512-bit message blocks. We're only going to concern ourselves with
one-block messages here.[^2]

[^2]: Once you can find one-block collisions, the Merkle-Damg√•rd construction makes it easy to turn these into multi-block collisions by simply appending identical message blocks to both messages.

The message block is broken up into sixteen consecutive 32-bit words, denoted
by $$m_0, m_{1}, ..., m_{15}$$.

The message block is mixed with the state through a series of three rounds. Each
round consists of sixteen steps; each step modifies one of the four state
variables as a function of the whole state plus a message word $$m_k$$.

Each message word is used exactly once per round. Each of the three rounds uses
a different round function. All three round functions have simple algebraic
representations.

Here's what the full process for hashing one block looks like:

{%
include blog-image.md
image="/assets/img/wang/md4-states.gif"
description="Animated GIF of a 32x48 grid of gray squares being filled in row-by-row"
%}

In that figure, the 32 bits of each intermediate MD4 state are represented
across consecutive rows of the grid. You can see the order in which message
words are mixed into the state. The dashed rectangle indicates which previous
states are involved in computing the next state at any given step.

The final MD4 hash value is a function of the last four rows of this state grid.
In other words, if two distinct inputs can produce the same values in these last
four rows, those inputs will collide.

## The Structure of MD4 (in detail)

The previous section covered the concepts involved in computing MD4; the attack
relies on those concepts, but it also relies on a number of (for lack of a
better term) implementation details.

As a reference for these details, you can find my full implementation of MD4
[here](https://github.com/wootfish/cryptopals/blob/master/challenge_30.py);
within that codebase, all three rounds are calculated [here](https://github.com/wootfish/cryptopals/blob/master/challenge_30.py#L66).
The most relevant aspects of the algorithm are also summarized below.

Let's start by defining three simple boolean functions, $$F, G, H$$. These are
used by our round functions.

$$
\begin{align}
F(x, y, z) &= (x \land y) \lor (\lnot x \land z)  \\
G(x, y, z) &= (x \land y) \lor (x \land z) \lor (y \land z)  \\
H(x, y, z) &= x \oplus y \oplus z
\end{align}
$$

Trivial collisions exist for all three of these functions. The paper lists these
on page 5:

{%
include blog-image.md
image="/assets/img/wang/md4-bool-collisions.png"
description="A screenshot from page 5 of the paper showing Propositions 1 through 3."
%}

These collisions are important to the theory of the attack (though not to its
implementation). For now, all you need to know is that $$F, G, H$$ are used by
the round functions $$r_1, r_2, r_3$$ respectively.

Here's what those round functions look like. As above, $$a, b, c, d$$ are our
four state variables. $$M = (m_0, m_1, ..., m_{15})$$ is a fixed 512-bit message.
$$k$$ is an index into $$M$$, and $$s$$ is an amount to left-rotate by.

All additions are performed modulo $$2^{32}$$.

$$
\begin{align}
r_1(a, b, c, d, k, s) &= (a + F(b, c, d) + m_k) \lll s \\
r_2(a, b, c, d, k, s) &= (a + G(b, c, d) + m_k + \texttt{5A827999}) \lll s \\
r_3(a, b, c, d, k, s) &= (a + H(b, c, d) + m_k + \texttt{6ED9EBA1}) \lll s
\end{align}
$$

In these definitions, $$\lll$$ denotes the 32-bit left-rotate operation.

Within each of $$r_1$$, $$r_2$$, and $$r_3$$, after the four state variables
$$a, b, c, d$$ are mixed together into a single value, the message word $$m[k]$$
is added in (mod $$2^{32}$$) and the result is left-rotated.

Left-rotation and modulo addition are both invertable operations when one of
their operands is known. This means that for any given arguments $$a, b, c, d, k,
s$$ and any desired result for the round, a simple algebraic method exists for
determining a value of $$m_k$$ which will produce that result. This gives us
almost[^3] full control over the outputs of $$r_1$$, $$r_2$$, and $$r_3$$.

[^3]: "Almost" because while we can control any individual round function's return value, we cannot trivially do so without side effects. This is not an issue when manipulating $$r_1$$, but it will factor into our analysis when we move on to later rounds.

Now, here's how the round functions are applied to compute the hash function's
intermediate states.

```python
# round 1
a = r1(a,b,c,d, 0,3,m); d = r1(d,a,b,c, 1,7,m); c = r1(c,d,a,b, 2,11,m); b = r1(b,c,d,a, 3,19,m)
a = r1(a,b,c,d, 4,3,m); d = r1(d,a,b,c, 5,7,m); c = r1(c,d,a,b, 6,11,m); b = r1(b,c,d,a, 7,19,m)
a = r1(a,b,c,d, 8,3,m); d = r1(d,a,b,c, 9,7,m); c = r1(c,d,a,b,10,11,m); b = r1(b,c,d,a,11,19,m)
a = r1(a,b,c,d,12,3,m); d = r1(d,a,b,c,13,7,m); c = r1(c,d,a,b,14,11,m); b = r1(b,c,d,a,15,19,m)

# round 2
a = r2(a,b,c,d,0,3,m); d = r2(d,a,b,c,4,5,m); c = r2(c,d,a,b, 8,9,m); b = r2(b,c,d,a,12,13,m)
a = r2(a,b,c,d,1,3,m); d = r2(d,a,b,c,5,5,m); c = r2(c,d,a,b, 9,9,m); b = r2(b,c,d,a,13,13,m)
a = r2(a,b,c,d,2,3,m); d = r2(d,a,b,c,6,5,m); c = r2(c,d,a,b,10,9,m); b = r2(b,c,d,a,14,13,m)
a = r2(a,b,c,d,3,3,m); d = r2(d,a,b,c,7,5,m); c = r2(c,d,a,b,11,9,m); b = r2(b,c,d,a,15,13,m)

# round 3
a = r3(a,b,c,d,0,3,m); d = r3(d,a,b,c, 8,9,m); c = r3(c,d,a,b,4,11,m); b = r3(b,c,d,a,12,15,m)
a = r3(a,b,c,d,2,3,m); d = r3(d,a,b,c,10,9,m); c = r3(c,d,a,b,6,11,m); b = r3(b,c,d,a,14,15,m)
a = r3(a,b,c,d,1,3,m); d = r3(d,a,b,c, 9,9,m); c = r3(c,d,a,b,5,11,m); b = r3(b,c,d,a,13,15,m)
a = r3(a,b,c,d,3,3,m); d = r3(d,a,b,c,11,9,m); c = r3(c,d,a,b,7,11,m); b = r3(b,c,d,a,15,15,m)
```

This code demonstrates a few important details of the algorithm's design: first,
the order in which previous intermediate states are passed to each invocation of
the round function; second, the order in which message blocks are used in each
round; third, the values of $$s$$ used in each call to the round functions.

In the code block above, intermediate states are grouped into rows of four.
Besides just looking nice, this mimics the paper's notation. This notation
denotes e.g. the first state on the first row as $$a_1$$, the third state on the
fourth row as $$c_4$$, and so on. $$a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0$$ denote the values to
which the four state variables $$a, b, c, d$$ are initialized.

The paper uses an extension of this notation to denote individual bits within
states: for instance, $$c_{4,1}$$ refers to $$c_4$$'s least significant bit,
$$d_{2,14}$$ refers to $$d_2$$'s 14th bit counting from the least significant
end, $$b_{9,32}$$ is $$b_9$$'s most significant bit (i.e. its 32nd-least
significant bit), and so on.

This notation is important because it is used to express all of the paper's
constraints on MD4's intermediate states. These constraints are central to the
attack.

Note that by the paper's convention, both subscripts here are 1-indexed rather
than 0-indexed.

A quick note on terminology: The original paper prefers the term _conditions_
over _constraints_ when discussing the rules it defines for MD4's intermediate
states. _Conditions_ is more in line with the attack's theoretical
underpinnings, but I feel that _constraints_ is more reflective of how these
rules are used when carrying out the attack. This post uses the two terms
interchangeably.

## Defining the Attack

The core of Wang's attack is a large list of constraints on the hash function's
intermediate states. Despite what the paper says, these do not quite form a set
of sufficient conditions, but they do come close. Here is the relevant table
(from page 16 of the paper):

{%
include blog-image.md
image="/assets/img/wang/wang-table-6.png"
description="Table 6: A Set of Sufficient Conditions for Collisions of MD4"
%}

This may look like a lot, but if you stare at it for long enough you'll start to
notice patterns. Nearly all of the constraints fall into three broad categories:
requiring that certain bits within intermediate states are either 0, 1, or equal
to the bit at the same index in a prior state (almost always the _immediately_
prior state). We can thus fit the bulk of these constraints into a three-part
taxonomy: we have _zero constraints_, _one constraints_, and _equality
constraints_. The only exceptions to this taxonomy are two constraints on
$$c_6$$, namely $$c_{6,30} = d_{6,30}+1$$ and $$c_{6,32} =
d_{6,32}+1$$.

The bulk of these constraints apply to first-round intermediate states. According
to Wang et al., satisfying the first-round constraints (i.e. everything up
through $$b_4$$) is enough to produce a collision with probability $$2^{-25}$$.
If _all_ the constraints are satisfied, then "the probability can be among
$$2^{-6} \sim 2^{-2}$$." This sounds pretty good, but don't get too excited just
yet.

If I can editorialize for a moment: The fact that Wang et al. give such a broad
range for the attack's success rate (between 25% and 1.5%) may imply that they
were unable to measure it directly, suggesting that even they did not have a
full methodology for enforcing _all_ of their conditions. They likely got close,
but how close is anyone's guess.

With that in mind, let's see how close _we_ can get.

The idea for the whole attack is something like this:

Generate a random input message; then, compute all the intermediate states
generated by hashing this message; in the process of computing these states,
derive and perform the message modifications necessary for these states to
satisfy as many of the conditions from Table 6 as possible.

Wang et al. simply call this "message modification", which is nice and
alliterative but also a little generic. We can do better: let's call this
message modification method a _message massage_.

Massaging the message to satisfy some of Wang et al.'s conditions greatly
increases the likelihood that $$H(m) = H(m + D)$$. The more conditions
satisfied, the higher the probability of success.

The next couple sections outline the message massage methodology. After that,
we'll take a look at the results of a successful massage.

## Massaging the Message: Round One

We'll start with the message modifications needed to satisfy our round 1
conditions.

The process for these is straightforward: just start at the start and work down
the list.

First, modify $$a_1$$ so that the condition $$a_{1,7} = b_{0,7}$$ is met. Then,
derive the message chunk required to produce this modified $$a_1$$. To do this,
we need to solve the round function $$r_1$$ for $$m_k$$, like so:

$$
\begin{align}
r_1(a, b, c, d, k, s) = (a + F(b, c, d) + m_k) \lll s \\
r_1(a, b, c, d, k, s) \ggg s = a + F(b, c, d) + m_k \\
(r_1(a, b, c, d, k, s) \ggg s) - a - F(b, c, d) = m_k \\
\end{align}
$$

If we know the value we want $$r_1$$ to evaluate to, we can use this to find the
message chunk which will produce that value. Let's work through an example --
here's $$a_1$$:

$$
\begin{align}
a_1 &= r_1(a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0, 0, 3) \\
a_1 &= (a_0 + F(b_0, c_0, d_0) + m_0) \lll 3 \\
m_0 &= (a_1 \ggg 3) - a_0 - F(b_0, c_0, d_0) \\
\end{align}
$$

You can apply this just as easily for any other intermediate state, say $$c_3$$:

$$
\begin{align}
c_3 &= r_1(c_2, d_2, a_2, b_2, 10, 11) \\
c_3 &= (c_2 + F(d_2, a_2, b_2) + m_{10}) \lll 11 \\
m_{10} &= (c_3 \ggg 11) - c_2 - F(d_2, a_2, b_2) \\
\end{align}
$$

It should be clear that this approach is applicable for each state in round 1,
meaning that we can follow this process to make message modifications ensuring
that all our conditions on $$a_1, d_1, c_1, ..., b_4$$ are met.

Massaging the message to enforce all the round one conditions is enough to bring
us to a success probability of roughly $$2^{-25}$$. That's not bad, but we can
do better - at the cost of some added complexity.

#### Massaging the Message: $$a_5$$

One thing I've glossed over so far: whenever we change an intermediate state,
this change has side effects on each subsequent intermediate state. For
instance, changing $$c_3$$ also implicitly changes $$b_3$$, $$a_4$$, $$d_4$$,
$$c_4$$, $$b_4$$, etc. Of course, the preceding states $$d_3$$, $$a_3$$,
$$b_2$$, $$c_2$$, $$d_2$$, etc, are all unchanged.

This is why our round one constraints have to be enforced in order: otherwise,
they would run the risk of overwriting each other.

When we get to round two, our process for deriving a new $$m_k$$ based on our
desired modifications still works, but with a caveat: any change we make will
propogates backward into round 1. For example, $$a_5$$ depends on $$m_0$$, but
so does $$a_1$$ -- so if we modify $$m_0$$ to enforce conditions on $$a_5$$,
we'll end up changing $$a_1$$ as well. This change will then propogate forward
to $$d_1, c_1, b_1, a_2, b_2$$, and so on, undoing all our hard work as it goes.

How can we prevent this? I'm glad you asked. Take a look at this diagram.

{%
include blog-image.md
image="/assets/img/wang/wang-a5-adjustments.svg"
description="Corrections for a5"
%}

This illustrates the process of correcting a second-round state, $$a_5$$. In
this case, the process consists of three steps.

The first step is shown in the leftmost section of the diagram, where $$a_5$$ is
adjusted to meet our constraints and $$m_0$$ is modified to produce the new
value of $$a_5$$. This change also alters the value of a previous state
($$a_1$$) and a later state ($$a_9$$, omitted from this diagram).

We don't really care if $$a_9$$ changes, since we haven't massaged that
state.[^4] The change to $$a_1$$, however, will have to be dealt with.

[^4]: In fact, no constraints are specified for $$a_9$$ and so we won't be massaging it at all.

First, there is the possibility that our change to $$m_0$$ modified $$a_1$$ in
such a way that our conditions on $$a_1$$ are no longer satisfied. Some
second-round conditions are more likely than others to mess up first-round
conditions; for whatever reason, the conditions for $$a_5$$ and $$a_1$$ seem to
coexist well.

If we _were_ to find our first-round constraints invalidated by our second-round
message massage, that would be a big problem. See the section on $$d_5$$ for an
example of one effective solution.

If the conditions on $$a_1$$ are still satisfied, we can move on to the next
step: containing the disruption caused by changing $$a_1$$'s value. This is
illustrated in the middle section of the diagram. $$a_1$$, shown in green, is in
a known-good state; its direct dependencies $$d_1, c_1, b_1, a_2$$ are
highlighted in yellow to indicate that they have been disrupted by the change to
$$a_1$$.

Recall that we can derive the message modification necessary to set any
intermediate state to any value (albeit not without side effects). If we've
saved the old values of $$d_1, c_1, b_1, a_2$$, we can just re-evaluate our
equation with the new value of $$a_1$$ to derive new message blocks $$m_2, m_3,
m_4, m_5$$ which will cause $$d_1, c_1, b_1, a_2$$ to evaluate to their old
values. Since these are $$a_1$$'s only direct dependencies, preventing them from
changing prevents any further changes from propogating through round 1.

Of course, making these changes to $$m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5$$ will create an even
greater ripple effect, disrupting other states in round 2. This is shown in the
third part of the diagram, where $$d_5, a_6, a_7, a_8$$ are highlighted to show
that their values have changed (changes to round 3 states are omitted to avoid
clutter).

The critical thing here is that all of these states occur _after_ the state
we're concerned with massaging ($$a_5$$). Thus we have managed to contain the
impact from modifying $$a_5$$ so that the only altered states are ones where no
constraints have yet been enforced -- meaning none of our work so far can be
disrupted.

Well... almost none. There is still a chance of messing up our _equality
constraints_. Take, for example, the constraint $$a_{2,14} = b_{1,14}$$.

Suppose we update $$a_{2}$$, and suppose further that we end up changing
$$a_{2,19}$$ in the process. Afterwards, as described above, we carefully make
sure to preserve the old value of $$d_2$$. Now, if $$a_{2,19} = d_{2,19}$$ prior
to these changes, then $$a_{2,19} \ne d_{2,19}$$ afterwards. In other words,
changing $$a_2$$ has the potential to break our constraints on $$d_2$$.

This can and will happen with many of our equality constraints, so whenever we
modify a state that appears in another state's equality constraints we have to
make sure that these equalities still hold.

As it happens, our modifications to $$a_{2}$$ don't tend to disrupt
$$a_{2,19}$$. When we move on to massaging $$d_5$$ and beyond, though, we will
have to take this into consideration.

#### Massaging the Message: $$d_5$$

Moving right along: Our next task is to massage $$d_5$$. This state takes
$$m_4$$ as input; $$m_4$$ is also used by $$a_2$$.

The considerations discussed above in the context of $$a_5$$ apply here as well,
but we have an additional challenge to overcome: our changes to $$d_5$$ have a
tendency to disrupt our earlier changes to $$a_2$$. The reverse is true as well:
if we re-massage $$a_2$$, our changes are likely to break the constraints for
$$d_5$$. The method we have been using thus far to satisfy sets of constraints
can get either $$a_2$$ or $$d_5$$ to a known-good state, but as long as we are
enforcing these constraint sets separately, we are very unlikely to end up
satisfying both of them at once.

There are several viable options here. My preferred solution is to combine the
two sets of constraints. We will find a way of translating them from constraints
on _states_ to constraints on _the corresponding message word from which those
states are derived_. This requires some careful bookkeeping, but it will allow
us to enforce both sets of constraints simultaneously, preventing them from
conflicting with each other.

Recall that the round functions $$r_1, r_2$$ are defined like so:

$$
\begin{align}
r_1(a, b, c, d, k, s) &= (a + F(b, c, d) + m_k) \lll s \\
r_2(a, b, c, d, k, s) &= (a + G(b, c, d) + m_k + \texttt{5A827999}) \lll s \\
\end{align}
$$

The values of $$a, b, c, d$$ come from previous states, so within any individual
state calculation we can take these values as constant. This allows us to
simplify the round functions somewhat. We'll start by consolidating the round
functions' constant terms; this will allow us to clean up the formulae for our
intermediate states:

$$
\begin{align}
N_1 &= a_1 + F(b_1, c_1, d_1) \\
N_2 &= d_4 + G(a_5, b_4, c_4) + \mathtt{0x5A827999} \\
\\
a_2 &= (N_1 + m_4) \lll 3 \\
d_5 &= (N_2 + m_4) \lll 5 \\
\\
a_2 \ggg 3 &= N_1 + m_4 \\
d_5 \ggg 5 &= N_2 + m_4
\end{align}
$$

Through these final equalities, we can translate constraints on $$a_2$$ and
$$d_5$$ into constraints on $$N_1 + m_4$$ and $$N_2 + m_4$$ respectively.

We will adapt our earlier notation to denote specific bits within these sums,
e.g. $$(N_2 + m_4)_5$$ for the 5th bit of $$N_2 + m_4$$.

Take the constraint $$a_{2,8} = 1$$. We can translate this as $$(N_1 + m_{4})_5
= 1$$. Note that the original constraint's index of 8 becomes 5 after
translation. Indices of $$a_2$$'s constraints need to be adjusted by 3, as
shown; indices for $$d_5$$'s constraints need to be adjusted by 5. This is to
compensate for the round functions' bit rotations. The rest of the translation
process is pretty simple.

The full list of translated constraints is as follows.

$$
\begin{align}
(N_1 + m_4)_5    &= 1 \\
(N_1 + m_4)_8    &= 1 \\
(N_1 + m_4)_{11} &= b_{1,14} \\
(N_2 + m_4)_{14} &= a_{5,19} \\
(N_2 + m_4)_{21} &= b_{4,26} \\
(N_2 + m_4)_{22} &= b_{4,27} \\
(N_1 + m_4)_{23} &= 0 \\
(N_2 + m_4)_{24} &= b_{4,29} \\
(N_2 + m_4)_{25} &= b_{4,30} \\
(N_2 + m_4)_{26} &= b_{4,32}
\end{align}
$$

As luck would have it, all of these constraints apply to distinct indices. If
this were not the case, then we would have a bit of an awkward situation,[^5]
but as things stand it is straightforward to enforce all of these at once.

[^5]: For instance, if we had (say) the constraints $$(N_1 + m_4)_5 = 0$$, $$(N_2 + m_4)_5 = 0$$, and $$N_{1,5} \ne N_{2,5}$$, then we would not be able to satisfy both constraints just by changing $$m_{4,5}$$. We could try flipping a lower-order bit in $$m_4$$; for example, if it turns out that $$N_{1,4} \ne N_{2,4}$$ then setting $$m_{4,4} = 1$$ would induce a carry on precisely one of $$N_1, N_2$$, which might be all we need. This method is somewhat involved and is not guaranteed to work. I have not used it in my implementation.

Our general methodology will be to work from low-order bits upward. For each
bit, we will note the value it has and the value we want it to have. If the
constraint is already satisfied, we do nothing; otherwise, we flip the
corresponding bit in $$m_4$$. Since addition is just xor with carries, this will
suffice to flip the bit in the sum. Note that this modification also has the
potential to modify higher-order bits in the sum, meaning we will have to
re-evaluate the sum after each modification to $$m_4$$.

After making the necessary changes to $$m_4$$, we will need to update $$m_5$$
thru $$m_9$$ to contain those changes' side effects. We will also want to
re-massage $$d_2$$ to ensure that its equality constraints with $$a_2$$ are
still met.

This method allows us to satisfy all of $$d_5$$'s constraints.

It is possible to massage the state further, but each further step adds new
complications and this post is already getting long.


## Tracking the State Differential

In order to see if our collision is working, we look at the `xor` difference of
the two messages' intermediate hash states. This shows us where state
differentials are introduced, as well as (hopefully) where they disappear.

Recall that MD4's final result is computed from the last four internal states;
as a corollary, if the last four rows of two messages' state differential are
all 0 then those two messages form a collision.

Here are the state differentials for one hundred random messages (hover to
animate):

name="/assets/img/wang/md4-differential-random"
%}

You can see exactly where the first message differentials are introduced, and
the resulting state differential, in the second and third rows of round one.
These early divergences quickly compound on themselves, and soon the
differential has diffused throughout the entire state.

Here are the state differentials for one hundred moderately massaged messages
(again, hover to animate):

{%
include blog-gif.html
name="/assets/img/wang/md4-differential-massaged"
%}

And finally, here are the state differentials for one hundred collisions
(hover):

{%
include blog-gif.html
name="/assets/img/wang/md4-differential-colliding"
%}

Recall that we showed earlier that two messages will collide when their state
grids' last four rows have a differential of 0. We can see that this is indeed
the case for all of our colliding messages.

The paper states (on page 7) that _it is clear that the collision differential
consists of two internal collisions respectively from 2-25 steps and 36-41
steps_. I think it's kind of cool how the above graphic allows us to visually
confirm this.

I haven't gone through the whole process of proving these internal collisions'
validity, but if I were to do so my proof strategy would make heavy use of the
boolean function collisions described above, since those give you conditions
under which any round's differentials will fail to propogate forward.

## Countermeasures

You may be wondering how modern hash functions defend against this sort of
attack. Well, there's a long answer and a short answer. The long answer could
fill a book; the short answer is that modern designs take greater pains to
ensure dispersion of differentials through the function's full internal state.

For instance, SHA-1 and SHA-2 use "message expansion" steps which expand the 16
words of a message block into input buffers of 80 or 64 words respectively. In
both cases, the expansion step is designed so that changing any of the 16
message chunks will result in a large number of changes throughout the expanded
message. Message expansion takes place before the (expanded) message is mixed
into the hash function's internal state. As a consequence, any small change to
the message will produce many more (and more complex) changes to the internal
state than in MD4.[^6]

[^6]: Note, though, that these measures are not automatically foolproof; see for example the recent chosen-prefix attack on SHA-1 (Leurent & Peyrin, 2020) ([PDF link](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf)).

Another defense is to simply build a hash function around something other than
the Merkle-Damg√•rd construction; a good example here is SHA-3, which uses a
radically different design based around a sponge function.

By definition, sponge function must provide effective dispersion of
differentials in order for sponge constructions to work. This is nontrivial to
ensure, but the resulting algorithms are strikingly simple and comes with
elegant security proofs. I'm no expert, but reading about SHA-3 and sponge
constructions makes me wonder why we haven't been building hash functions this
way all along.

## Conclusion

That just about does it for the theory behind Wang's attack. Tune in next time
for a discussion of how the attack might be implemented cleanly and efficiently
in Python.
