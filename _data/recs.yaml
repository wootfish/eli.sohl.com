  - title: The Dispossessed
    desc:
      - If this book had found its way to me a decade or two earlier it would
        have significantly changed my life for the better. Perfect gift idea.
      - >
        The gist: It's set on an earth-like planet (Urras), and that planet's
        moon (Anarres); the moon has been colonized by utopian anarchists who
        have now spent a couple centuries up there. Their stance towards Urras
        is isolationist. It's a hard but good life, but with limited
        opportunities for academic life, and so Shevek, a brilliant Anarresti
        physicist, decides to take the unprecedented step of leaving the moon
        to study at the universities of Urras. Chaos ensues. This narrative is
        interleaved with flashbacks to his earlier life on Anarres.
      - >
        The narrative engages with an incredible range of themes: anarchism,
        personal and collective freedom, capitalism, social control,
        colonialism, revolutionary politics, sexuality, friendship, physics,
        metaphysics, class struggle, environmentalism, and more - all of which
        I would say it navigates maturely and clearheadedly. Somehow, despite
        that intense fare, it is never pretentious.
      - Solid chaos pick for a book club, especially a politically diverse one.

      - title: Walkaway
        desc: Walkaway substitutes the desert in place of the moon and
          compresses the time-scale a bit, but otherwise it has a lot in common
          with this narrative, and engages with similar themes (in some cases
          taking them much further). Walkaway feels a bit less grounded and
          more explicitly utopian, but if you like one of these books, you'll
          probably like the other.
      - title: The Conquest of Bread
        desc: The Anarresti colonists' political philosophy comes from Odo, who
          politically seems to be sort of a mix of Marx and Kropotkin; her
          formalisms (and cult following) more resemble Marx, but her prose
          style and flavor of anarchism are totally aligned with Kropotkin. So
          if you liked her ideas, why not follow them to the source?
      - title: A Paradise Built in Hell
        desc: >
          The Anarresti's resilience in the face of hardship might seem
          unrealistic, if it weren't for all the evidence that people in
          similar real-world situations actually do behave similarly. This book
          is a collection of such evidence: it's a series of case studies of
          disasters, with a focus on how the people caught in them interact.
          Absolutely fascinating and very ideologically aligned.

  - title: Seveneves
    desc:
      - Extraordinarily depressing. The Earth is doomed, we have to go to space
        asap, but it's gonna be really hard and not everyone can make it. Once
        we're in space, we'll have to stay there for a long, long time. The
        survival of humanity is uncertain. The one thing we know for sure is,
        it's gonna take a lot of hard sci-fi to get us through this.
      - Fairly long and discursive, as Neal Stephenson tends to be. This one is
        set over a very long time scale. It plays with a lot of ideas, though I
        can't expand too much on that without giving away plot points. This is
        Stephenson's take on classic sci-fi, writing about spaceships and
        astrophysics and thruster burns and all that nerd shit. If you're into
        that, you'll find a satisfying number of fresh ideas here. If you're
        not into that, you'll probably get bored pretty quickly.
    cf:
      - title: Governing the Commons
        desc: For most of Seveneves, no one has enough. I forget if the phrase
          "tragedy of the commons" is ever actually invoked directly, but the
          idea is constantly hanging in the air. Resources are scarce and hard
          to manage. Governing the Commons is a collection of case studies of
          how this problem has been solved in practice, in the real world. If
          themes of scarcity are interesting to you, you might find this
          interesting, too.
      - title: Anathem
        desc: Another long, discursive Stephenson novel. Stylistically, these
          two novels have a lot in common. They're both full to the seams with
          ideas. In both cases, Stephenson does not seem to care how long it
          takes to work through those ideas, the plot will just have to wait
          until he's had his fun, thank you very much. If (like me) you also
          find that fun, give this novel a try. As a bonus, it's also a lot
          less depressing than Seveneves.

  - title: The Conquest of Bread
    desc:
      - >
        A very famous book. Unfortunately considered cliche to recommend to
        people, but it's good enough that I don't care. You've probably already
        heard of it, and probably have your own opinions about it. Just in case
        you haven't: this book's author, Peter Kropotkin, is one of the
        best-known historic anarchists, and this is his most famous book. It is
        the most accessible book of anarchist political theory that I'm aware
        of.
      - >
        This book is from the 1890s, but for the most part it has aged
        extraordinarily well. Kropotkin was a revolutionary, but he does not
        touch on that here. This book does not deal at all with
        how-we-get-there - rather, in a move that is almost cliche, it picks up
        immediately "after the revolution", asking a simple question: now that
        we're finally reshaping society, what value should we place at its core?
      - >
        His simple answer: "well-being for all". This might sound obvious, but
        he argues compellingly that previous revolutions have failed precisely
        because they failed to uphold this value. In his words, they all forgot
        to account for bread. A revolution can only sustain itself so long on
        ideals alone; it needs to back them up with material improvements in
        quality of life - in other words, it needs to look after well-being for
        all.
      - Well, ok, but what does that mean? This is the question that he spends
        the rest of the book answering, in incredible detail, often with
        empirical figures to back up his arguments.
      - He argues that (using 1890s technology!) we could feed, house, clothe,
        and entertain everyone without asking anyone to work more than five
        hours a day. As an aside, I would <i>love</i> to see someone come up
        with an update to this figure that accounts for modern technology. It
        would not be an easy task, but I'm sure the figure would be striking.
      - >
        My favorite thing about this book is the writing style: It's a very
        casual form of rhetoric, where many of the lines of argument feel like
        they could have been workshopped in barroom debates. I have no idea if
        that's historically accurate, but it's endearing - it offers the text a
        certain unpretentious accessibility that a lot of political writing
        just doesn't have.
      - If you have opinions about anarchism, you probably already know this
        book. If you don't, this is the book to read. Also, he talks about
        trains a ton, so if you're the kind of person who likes that, you'll
        have a great time.
    cf:
      - title: Occult Features of Anarchism
        desc: Another of my favorite books on anarchist studies, though more
          focused on history than theory. Kropotkin shows up in it at times.
      - title: Walkaway
        desc: Walkaway is basically Conquest of Bread fanfiction (in a good way).
      - title: The Dispossessed
        desc: Odo, the fictional anarchist political theorist whose ideas are
          woven throughout Dispossessed, would agree with Kropotkin on a whole
          lot of stuff. A very interesting, mature, even-handed exploration of
          how those ideas play out on personal, interpersonal, and societal
          levels.

  - title: White Noise
    desc:
      - I wrote more about this book <a href="/2017/09/12/book-notes.html">here</a>,
        so I'll try to avoid rehashing those notes. In brief, this is DeLillo
        in top form, dealing with themes like information overload, the way
        horrifying realities can become trivialized under scrutiny, the ways
        power structures impose themselves through systems of communication,
        the way those structures become mirrored in interpersonal dynamics, the
        implicit hazards of all of the above, and the ways these themes shape
        our subconscious desires.
      - If you can't tell, I'm having a hard time describing what it's about.
        It gets into big themes. If that all sounds too high-concept for you, I
        don't blame you, but I promise the book itself is surprisingly
        readable. It doesn't hit you over the head with this stuff; rather, it
        just provides an extremely rich text to dig into. DeLillo is the master
        of suggesting this stuff without outright saying it. I admire his
        restraint.
      - The perfect novel to write an overambitious college essay on.
    cf:
      - title: Data and Goliath
        desc: Inasmuch as White Noise is a cautionary tale, it is warning us
          about many of the same things that Data and Goliath warns have come
          to pass.
      - title: Obfuscation
        desc: I'll take any chance I can find to recommend this little book,
          but I do think it ties in here, and in an optimistic kind of way.
          In White Noise, reality is becoming increasingly suffused with, well,
          noise, and it is not a good time. In Obfuscation, noise is not
          necessarily a bad thing; rather, it can be problematic or helpful
          depending on context, and we can benefit from knowing when and how to
          use it to our advantage.

  - title: Walkaway
    desc:
      - This was part of a trifecta of books I read (Walkaway - A Paradise
        Built in Hell - The Conquest of Bread) that quite literally reversed my
        outlook on life. I was a very cynical person, and one of the things that
        dragged me out of that particular tar pit was the experience of seeing my
        own ideals reflected back at me through this book. Never before had I
        read something and agreed so thoroughly with it.
      - I've written about it at more length <a href="/2017/09/12/book-notes.html">here</a>.
        Suffice to say I recommend it highly - I think there's something in it
        for just about anyone, at least as long as they're mature enough to not
        be scandalized by a handful of sex scenes.
      - If I were somehow suddenly placed in charge of distributing a
        billionaire's fortune, I would start a foundation dedicated to trying
        to make every piece of sci-fi technology from Walkaway real. That would
        be my plan. No more, no less. Can't happen soon enough.
      - The most quietly radical aspect of this book is the argument it makes
        in favor of having a place to fuck off <i>to</i>. There are whole parts
        of their world that are so unpleasant as to have been abandoned in
        favor of walled cities. This might sound bad, but it leaves room for
        experimentation, which is something we have painfully little of today.
    cf:
      - title: The Conquest of Bread
        desc: The characters of Walkaway don't realize they're anarchists. They
          just kind of do anarchism by accident, because it makes sense at the
          time. I love that. That said, I really wish they would please all
          read a fucking book, and this is the book I'd give them. Then again,
          maybe they wouldn't need it, because they pretty much live it.
      - title: A Paradise Built in Hell
        desc: Walkaway is the story of a utopia-within-a-dystopia. Basically,
          modern life becomes so horrible that the war-scarred, abandoned,
          rubble-strewn desert becomes relatively appealing by comparison. Life
          is hard out there, but the things that make it hard are things you
          can come together against, rather than things that divide you. This
          narrative has so much overlap with the themes of A Paradise Built in
          Hell. That's not a coincidence, either - I actually first heard of
          that book when Doctorow mentioned it during a radio interview for
          Walkaway.
      - title: The Dispossessed
        desc: A very similar book in a lot of ways. There are big differences,
          but the themes they grapple with are similar, although Walkaway's
          treatment of them feels at times less grounded and more hyperbolic.

  - title: Silence on the Wire
    desc:
      - One of the first books on security that I ever read, and, to this day,
        one of my favorites.
      - Ignore every synopsis of this book online. They undersell it. It seems
        to me like no one was quite sure how to sell this book because no one
        was quite sure what it was or who it was for. The answer is, it's a
        grab bag with a few cool ideas at every level of abstraction in a
        computer system circa 2005. There are a few nominal through-lines
        connecting these ideas, but really it's just a masterclass in
        discursive exposition. As for who it's for, the answer is - hackers. In
        the classic sense, where a "hacker" approaches a computer with
        curiosity and tries to do surprising things with it, this is the
        clearest expression of a "hacker mindset" that I've ever seen.
      - >
        In fact, I'll go further: this book is, to me, the high water mark for
        accessible technical writing. Many people would tell you that it's
        possible for technical writing to be either precise or conversational
        but not both at once. Zalewski proves those people wrong. It reminds me
        of how some great teachers can ramble for an hour and somehow manage to
        hit every beat in their lesson plan, while you're so drawn-in that you
        don't even realize you're learning.
      - If you look this book up up online, you can find a preview for the
        first couple chapters and the table of contents. Check it out and see
        if it hooks you. I really recommend it.
    cf:
      - title: Security Engineering
        desc: Really it's hard to compare Silence on the Wire to anything else,
          because I've never read another book like it. That said, part of its
          appeal is how broad its range of topics is, and this is where the
          comparison to Security Engineering comes in - this latter book, while
          somewhat drier, is one of the only books I've seen that has the guts
          to take on a comparably broad scope and actually deliver on it.

  - title: A Paradise Built in Hell
    desc:
      - One for the cynics. It is broadly considered common sense, especially
        in america, to assume that in a crisis situation people will instantly
        be at each other's throats. Everyone thinks they'll be the one
        level-headed person surrounded by maniacs. Some people often ask
        themselves whether they could, if need be, act as a maniac in order to
        survive among them.
      - Disaster movies reinforce this narrative at every opportunity, framing
        catastrophes as moments of rupture where subterranean resentments can
        finally erupt to the surface, simmering conflicts instantly come to a
        rolling boil, and well-intentioned people are the first ones to die.
      - What's interesting is, this is the opposite of what happens in real
        life. A Paradise Built in Hell (subtitled "the extraordinary
        communities that arise in disaster") is a book about what happens in
        real life.
      - It starts with the great San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906.
        Next up is the Halifax munitions accident of 1917, which at the time
        was the largest artificial explosion in history. Then we skip forward
        to the 1985 earthquake in Mexico City. After that come Katrina and
        9/11.
      - >
        This might sound like depressing fare, but what saves it is the book's
        focus: on the people who survived, on what their lives were like at the
        center of these moments, on what they did, who they did it with, and
        how they looked back on the events after they were over.
      - The common themes are of people coming together, setting aside
        differences, uniting in a common struggle - basically all those cliche
        utopian ideals that we want to believe in but usually reject as naive.
        Well, here they are, writ large and told through first-person accounts.
      - The author, Rebecca Solnit, is one of my favorite authors currently
        working. This is sort of an outlier in her extensive bibliography, less
        autobiographical than usual, but somehow it feels just as personal,
        because you can see her values reflected through the stories she has
        collected and shared here.

  - title: The Utopia of Rules
    desc:
      - A collection of essays by David Graeber on the subject of bureaucracy.
        Sounds dry, but it isn't. He had a freakish, prodigious capacity for
        analysis, and it's on full display here. Thought-provoking stuff.

  - title: Anathem
    desc:
      - My favorite Neal Stephenson novel. Incredibly long and discursive. Very
        chill.
      - There is a giant circular wall, which has stood for thousands of years.
        Inside lives an order of monastic academics. There is a gate in the
        wall; every year, this door to the outside world opens once. Within
        this circle is a second wall, with a second gate; this one opens every
        ten years. Likewise twice more, with the innermost wall's gate opening
        only on the millenium. Aside from these openings, these scholar-monks
        live in voluntary isolation from the outside world, eschewing advanced
        technology and leading simple lives of thought and study.
      - Of course, the plot demands that their isolation be interrupted;
        however, a good portion of the book takes place before that
        interruption. This portion just charts what life would be like inside
        these walls. What are the dramas of their lives? What are their goals
        and dreams? What are the big decisions they have to make? What might
        cause these people to come together or grow apart? How do they spend a
        lazy afternoon, or a lazy summer? This, to me, is the best part of the
        book.
      - That said, once the plot gets properly underway, it is very engaging
        and interesting.
      - This is the only book I've ever read where an
        important plot point hinged on the question of whether or not Platonic
        metaphysics is empirically verifiable.

  - title: Grow Your Own
    desc:
      - One of the many books that someone bought for me as a joke, but that I
        have enjoyed in earnest. I don't (have enough space to) grow weed, but
        if I did, this book would be my bible. It also contains a lot of
        interesting information that is useful to the more casual enjoyer.

  - title: "Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius"
    desc:
      - Ray Monk is an incredible biographer and he <i>might</i> have had a
        history-crush on Wittgenstein. I don't want to make any assumptions,
        but, having read this book, I can't rule it out.
      - This book is exactly what a biography should be. It's fun, engaging,
        full of anecdotes and details, but it does not compromise on its
        technical content at all. The author is a full-on decorated professor
        of philosophy who is more than capable of explaining every stage of
        Wittgenstein's thought. The framing device of biography allows him to
        do so "in real time", so to speak, explaining the ideas as they occur
        to Wittgenstein, and contextualizing them against his life at the time.
        This is especially valuable because he was unusually prone to arguing
        against his own earlier ideas, and charting the development of these
        arguments historically makes his self-dialogue much more approachable.
      - >
        What emerges is a compelling portrait of someone who wanted, more than
        anything else, to do something remarkable. This book's subtitle, "The
        Duty of Genius", might feel a bit, oh, pretentious, or extravagant, but
        it's an accurate description of how Wittgenstein seems to have
        understood his own life: he was brilliant, he had incredible potential,
        and he felt that it was his duty to live up to that. (The fact that he
        spent his formative years in the shadow of his incredibly precocious
        older siblings probably did not help with this.)
      - But at the same time, he was a fucking nerd - he picked out doorknobs
        and chandeliers for his sister's house and then put "architect" on his
        letterhead for a full decade afterwards. He was crazy - in one of the
        book's funnier anecdotes, he enlists in the army after deciding he
        hasn't experienced enough hardship (really!), but due to his family's
        influence he's assigned a desk job, so he goes to request reassignment,
        confusing the officer on duty who takes a while to realize he wants to
        go <i>to</i> the front lines! And he was maybe-very-probably gay -
        though we don't have conclusive evidence afaik, it's like, come on. The
        guy did some of his best work while sharing a two-person rowboat with
        his guy friend who happened to come visit him in the mountains for a
        few months. There is a neverending series of scenes like this, each
        more rife with subtext than the last. If it were fiction it would be
        blatant queerbaiting.
      - Wittgenstein has a reputation as one of the more difficult, if not
        impossible, of the modern philosophers - undeniably brilliant, but hard
        to read even on a good day. If you're interested, this might be the
        most approachable introduction to his work (and life!) that you'll
        find.

  - title: Data and Goliath
    desc:
      - Schneier's best book (in my opinion). And yes, I'm including the books
        on cryptography, which were epochal for their time but are showing
        their age. This book is encyclopedic. I wrote about in more detail
        <a href="2017/09/12/book-notes.html">here</a>, though I might have laid
        the praise on a little heavy (it's amazing what six years of
        perspective can do).
      - Basically, this is <i>the</i> book on big data and surveillance circa
        2015. It is comprehensive and packed to the seams with details. One of
        the most information-dense books I've ever read. I was amazed by how
        many of the projects described in it were unfamiliar to me, even though
        I do my best to keep up with the news in this space.
      - This book is almost a decade old at this point, and I'd love to see an
        updated edition, but it is still worth reading.

  - title: The History of Western Philosophy
    desc:
      - >
        Full disclosure: I read this cover-to-cover in high school, and I
        referred back to it in college as my English classes required. Other
        than that, I haven't gone back to it since, so I'm writing from
        memory here. But I recall this being a very good book.
      - Bertrand Russell's greatest skill was repackaging others' ideas for a
        lay audience. That sounds like an insult, and I haven't made up my mind
        about whether or not I intend it as one. But the fact is, this is a
        useful skill and it makes him the ideal author for this type of book.
      - The book's scope is startlingly broad. It starts in pre-Socratic
        Greece, and just continues forward from there, recounting the views and
        ideas of everyone who Russell thought to be worth including. He limits
        the scope to western philosophers, which is unfortunate but not
        surprising, and still leaves him with plenty of good material.
      - In particular, he never fails to point out what he perceives to be the
        flaws in other philosophers' works. Sometimes I agree with him and
        sometimes I think he is arguing against strawmen; that said, either
        way, this stuff is great essay fuel and is consistently entertaining.

  - title: Suspended in Language
    desc:
      - I read this book as a kid and I enjoyed it very much. I've revisited it
        many times - it might be the most heavily worn book on my shelf. This
        book - I guess it's technically a graphic novel, but who cares - paints
        a beautiful, compelling, personal view of Niels Bohr. He was a talented
        physicist, but also one who was in the right place at the right time
        with the right ideas; what makes him interesting is the degree to which
        those ideas, while correct, seem to have come to him by something other
        than the scientific method.
      - >
        This is not to talk down on him as a scientist: he was definitely a
        scientist, and a very good one. He was also a philosopher and a poet,
        and someone who was not afraid of proceeding by guesswork. It is
        interesting to see how this played out in his interactions with his
        colleagues and students.
      - In his personal life, he seems to have been - according to the picture
        painted in this book - gentle, soft-spoken, moral, kind, diplomatic,
        and just an all-around great guy. This is an easy image to keep up in
        peace, but Bohr lived through the second world war, and one of the
        book's most compelling chapters recounts his encounter with Werner
        Heisenberg - who was working for the germans - during the war. The
        depiction is haunting, historically accurate, honest about the limits
        of what is known about their conversation, and beautifully drawn.
      - I love stories about the lives of scientists. These are people who give
        themselves over completely to one thing. Why do they do it? Who are
        they? What drives them? What is the rest of their life like? What
        relationships do they have with their colleagues? These are the
        questions I want to see explored, and this book shares my interests.

    desc:
      - Diane Williams is a treasure. These are tiny stories, and this will be
        a tiny review. The book is good, easy to read, and rewarding to dwell
        on. I've written about it before. It's from McSweeney's, which as a
        publishing house tends to be terminally twee, but they really scored
        big on this one.

  - title: The Faraway Nearby
    desc:
      - From Rebecca Solnit (see also A Paradise Built in Hell). A delightful
        combination of memoir, literary analysis, biography, and more. It
        defies description and feels almost like stunt-writing, like something
        that shouldn't work but does, like she picked five or ten topics from a
        hat and committed to writing about all of them at once, just to see if
        she could - and it turns out she can, The book is a nonstop series of
        unexpected threads that combine and weave these topics together into a
        coherent whole. You almost can't believe your eyes as you're reading
        it. She is so good at this. A delight to read, as always.
      - I have more detailed notes that I'll dig up and put here eventually,
        but for now this will have to do.

  - title: The Breakthrough to Shodan
    desc:
      - >
        I've read many books on Go. This is the one I recommend. It is not an
        introductory book (for that, Kaoru Iwamoto's book would be a good
        choice), but once you've reached single-digit kyu strength, this is
        what you should read. One pro player has joked that the book should be
        titled "The Breakthrough to Professional Shodan" (i.e. approximately 9
        Dan).
      - >
        A point of disambiguation: "Shodan" is an overloaded word. In Go, it
        refers to the changeover point where a former Kyu-ranked player earns
        their first Dan rank. This is analogous to the changeover to a black
        belt in some martial arts (which, in fact, seem to have borrowed the
        kyu/dan system from Go). For most amateur players, achieving a dan
        rating is their ultimate goal. It certainly is mine.
      - >
        [I'm currently rated around 3 Kyu on OGS](https://online-go.com/player/95926/)
        (feel free to send me a challenge if you play, by the way!), so I can't
        say the book has worked for me yet, but that's my own fault. I can say
        with confidence that it has measurably improved my game.

  - title: "Invincible: The Games of Shusaku"
    desc:
      - This is "the one book every professional Go player has read" and with
        good reason. Shusaku is probably the most famous Go player of all time.
      - >
        Quoting from Wikipedia: "He is known for his undefeated streak of 19 games during the annual castle games; his thirty-game match with Ota Yuzo; the eponymous Shusaku opening; and his posthumous veneration as a "Go sage". Next to his teacher, Hon'inbō Shūwa, he is considered to have been the strongest player from 1847/8 to his death in 1862."
      - The book contains not just game records but professional commentary and
        a biographical preface as well. It is quite a good read, as long as you
        like Go and have a board at home to play along to the games with.
        Shusaku's style is captivating and generally considered to be an
        excellent example for amateur players to emulate.

  - title: "Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies"
    desc:
      - Carl Jung writes about what the hell is going on with flying saucers.
        This was one of his last books, and he clearly was far beyond giving a
        fuck what anyone thought, which I love for him.
      - He's not a "true believer" per se - his question is less "what are
        UFOs" and more "why do so many people care so much about something so
        weird". He makes the good point that this is a shared myth, but
        (arguably) a completely modern one - something that appeared out of
        nowhere and suddenly spread like wildfire. Regardless of whether it can
        be substantiated, clearly it resonates with people, and he spends the
        rest of this (fairly short) book trying to figure out why that is and
        what these images mean to people.
      - You could argue that there are historic precedents to modern stories of
        flying saucers, and there's probably a case to be made there, but that
        doesn't invalidate Jung's point, which is that even if this myth did
        previously exist, it died out for a long time before suddenly appearing
        again out of nowhere and spreading like wildfire. The rate of spread
        was extremely unusual pre-internet, and its staying power remains
        exceptional even today.
      - The meat of the book is in a series of dream analyses where patients
        describe their dreams of flying saucers, which he analyzes in terms of
        motifs and archetypes. To be honest, the analysis mostly went over my
        head - my reaction was a lot of "yeah, man, I guess now that you've
        said it I can see that, but I never would have gotten there on my own".
        That said, it was still an entertaining read.

  - title: Cryptonomicon
    desc:
      - One of Neal Stephenson's masterpieces. A book that defies description.
        Spans multiple generations of multiple families, whose fates intertwine
        in all kinds of fascinating ways.
      - A young mathematician befriends Alan Turing and goes on bike rides with
        him; later, he helps Turing in the war effort by building a hydraulic
        computer. Two characters - one of whom might secretly be immortal - are
        imprisoned in adjoining cells, and pass encrypted messages using a
        cipher that is calculated using a deck of playing cards
        ([and which was invented for the novel by Bruce Schneier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_(cipher))).
        A commando and his civilian lover hook up under increasingly surreal
        circumstances. Several characters collaborate to build an offshore data
        haven and invent Bitcoin (this book was published in 1999!) A character's
        computer gets [Van Eck phreaked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking).
        And that's not even half of the crazy stuff that happens in here.
      - I can barely keep up with Stephenson's new stuff, but when I finally
        get caught up I'm going back to this one. It's not his only masterpiece -
        I'd also recommend Anathem and Interface, among others - but this is a great
        book.
      - I read this as a kid because I accidentally requested it from the
        library when I was intending to get a copy of Neuromancer. In my
        defense, both titles have an unreasonable number of syllables, and
        anyway, it turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.

  - title: How to Solve It
    desc:
      - A famous book written by the even more famous George Pólya. This book
        is to mathematicians what The Breakthrough to Shodan is to Go players.
        It's a series of short chapters, each of which describes a
        problem-solving strategy - or in some cases a meta-strategy or
        heuristic - followed by a series of problems for which the strategy at
        hand is unreasonably effective.
      - We're talking here about proofs and derivations, not arithmetic, to be
        clear. This isn't about how to add numbers together, but rather about
        how to come up with formal arguments for specific formal results - and
        in that sense much of this book is applicable to a much broader group
        of people than just mathematicians.
      - Computer scientists don't need to think this hard nearly as often as
        mathematicians do, but if you practice this stuff, you'll be way ahead
        of most of the pack. And besides, it's just a fun read.

  - title: The Art and Craft of Problem Solving
    desc:
      - For people who read How to Solve It and say "I want more". This book
        was written as a textbook for students competing in math olympiads. It
        is extraordinarily comprehensive and detailed. If you know a kid who's
        really into math but doesn't have the right resources, get them a copy
        of this book, and do it as soon as possible.
      - I'll admit that I have not finished the book, because it is long and
        dense, but I have a very high opinion of it. It also gave rise to an
        online forum (The Art of Problem Solving, or AoPS) where a lot of
        olympiad types and former competitors hang out.

  - title: An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography
    desc:
      - >
        This gives you a full view of half of a field. It's a bit lopsided, but
        the stuff it covers, it covers very well.
      - >
        I have had a couple people ask me, either personally or on behalf of
        friends, whether there's a path for math grad students to get into
        cryptography. My answer: yes, and it starts with this book.
      - >
        It is part of the "undergraduate texts in mathematics" series, but
        don't let that fool you: some of the math it discusses is fairly heavy-duty.
        That said, it does a good job of building up to the advanced stuff, so
        if you come in with a basic undergraduate knowledge of concepts like
        modular arithmetic, it can get you the rest of the way there. Even so,
        YMMV depending on how much you like math.

  - title: Serious Cryptography
    desc:
      - If you're a developer who doesn't want to _do_ cryptography, but does
        want to have an idea of what it involves, this is the book for you. If
        you've been tasked with doing something crypto-related, this is the
        book to read first (and then once you're done, I very strongly
        recommend hiring a consultancy to check your work - like, for example,
        my employer - but I digress).
      - I've written more about this book previously, so I'll cut this note off
        here. It's a good book.

  - title: Introduction to Modern Cryptography
    desc:
      - My holy book. Very thorough in scope. Detailed but readable. Includes
        lots of trivia (like - no pun intended - a discussion of the freakishly
        simple-yet-unbroken stream cipher [Trivium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium_(cipher))
        as a companion to the discussion of LFSRs).
      - If you want to get serious about cryptography, you might not read this
        book first, but you must read it at some point. For a while, Schneier's
        "Applied Cryptography" held that title, but no longer; Introduction to
        Modern Cryptography has taken the title and I doubt it'll give it up
        any time soon.

      - title: Obfuscation
        desc: There is some overlap in subject matter here. Obfuscation is more
          academic and less directly actionable, but worth reading nonetheless.

  - title: Security Engineering
    desc:
      - This book has the most boring title imaginable, and the writing style
        is a little dry, but the actual subject matter could not be more
        interesting.
      - I often describe books as having broad scopes, but this time I really
        mean it. Look up the table of contents and see for yourself. No,
        really.
      - >
        If you want to get started as a security consultant, you should read
        two books: one for whatever speciality you want to develop, and one to
        get you conversant in the rest of the field. This book fills that
        second role better than any other book I know of.

  - title: "Bertrand Russell: The Spirit of Solitude"
    desc:
      - Can a factual biography also be a hit piece? No one was asking this
        question, but nevertheless, here we have the answer.
      - This was written by Ray Monk, who also did the extraordinarily good
        biography of Wittgenstein that I've mentioned elsewhere on this page.
        Wittgenstein and Russell's lives intersected many times, and they
        corresponded heavily, so (as I understand the story) after Ray Monk
        finished his Wittgenstein book, he realized he was already halfway to a
        book on Russell and he figured, what the hell, let's finish it off.
      - >
        The catch: He _really does not like Bertrand Russell._ And when you
        read this book, you will understand why. It's important to emphasize
        that Monk is not _unfair_ to the man, but he is absolutely merciless in
        his choice of (for example) extended block quotes from Russell's
        absolutely mortifyingly cringeworthy unrequited love letters.
      - It might sound unfair to pull from those, but it's important to
        understand that Russell wrote a _lot_ of letters, and a lot of these
        were love letters. My man was writing letters at the rate most of us
        send texts, and that is not an exaggeration.
      - >
        The love letters aren't the worst of it, though: in one episode,
        Russell goes out on a walk, realizes on this walk that he no longer
        loves his wife, and does what any reasonable person would do in such a
        situation: he returns home and tells her the news. Monk's sympathy for
        her is palpable as he describes the impact this had on her life (she
        was devastated and, it seems, never fully recovered).
      - >
        In fairness: Russell had a very traumatic childhood (which this book
        will tell you all about) and it seems he ended up as an emotionally
        malformed adult (which this book will also tell you all about). The man
        is lucky to have been a sharp philosopher and a member of the british
        aristocracy, both of which meant that he had a wider range of options
        than most of us who come from similar backgrounds, but nevertheless his
        life was full of a series of horrors and humiliations that feel cribbed
        from cringe comedy. In fact, if any TV writers are reading this: adapt
        this book. It'll kill.
      - The most compelling - and most painful - parts of the book come from
        Russell's interactions with background characters, like the prison
        guard (while Russell was jailed for protesting) who was unexpectedly
        nice to Russell, but who was the target of almost unlimited scorn in
        the latter's letters after his release in a series of passages that
        reek of british classism exacerbated by a total lack of self-awareness.
      - >
        I still respect Russell's writings (I have his History of Western
        Philosophy on this list, and I've read and enjoyed some of his other
        works as well, like his Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy) but I
        was completely floored at this biography's picture of him. That said, I
        simply could not put it down, either. It's that classic dilemma: You
        don't want to look, but you can't look away.

  - title: Feng Shui for You and Your Cat
    desc:
      - One of the many books that has been bought for me as a joke, but that I
        have thoroughly and unironically enjoyed. This book helped me decide
        where to place my desk, and it worked perfectly.
      - >
        The basic argument: Feng Shui is (in simple, bastardized, westernized
        terms) about balancing flows of energy within a space. You don't want
        a space to feel too chaotic or too stagnant - you want areas of rest
        and areas of motion, with balance between them.
      - By watching how your cat engages with the spaces you put them in, you
        can see what they understand to be the areas of rest and motion - where
        do they sleep, and where do they go to run around when they've got the
        2 AM crazies?
      - In this sense, your cat is engaged in dialogue with the space around
        them, and you can listen in on this dialogue and use it to inform how
        you design your space. This sounds kind of crazy, but it actually
        works. The rest of the book goes into way more detail about Feng Shui
        concepts and how they can be seen through this lens, and it is a
        surprisingly approachable, down-to-earth, and even convincing
        exposition of something that I always thought to be kind of hand-wavey
        and disreputable.
      - In particular, because your cat doesn't know Feng Shui, they are
        completely incapable of being taken in by any new-age nonsense, which
        makes them an excellent collaborator.

  - title: Governing the Commons
    desc:
      - Elinor Ostrom's book on how the Tragedy of the Commons is made-up
        bullshit that's not real, and on how commons can be managed in real
        life.
      - >
        The book takes a ton of case studies of shared resources: pastures,
        fisheries, water supplies, etc - the exact places where conventional
        economic wisdom would tell us to expect cutthroat behavior,
        backstabbing, sociopathic scheming, and so on, and it finds that the
        only people who actually behave in this way in these settings are
        economists, who tend to quickly get shown the door.
      - OK, that was a bit glib, let me try again. She goes through case
        studies of how communities manage commons across the world, and
        synthesizes a series of observations on what the necessary and
        sufficient conditions are for preventing the tragedy of the commons.
        Fascinating stuff that flies in the face of a lot of conventional
        "wisdom".
      - The writing is fairly dry and technical - understandably so,
        considering that it was written to predict and deflect criticisms from
        the absolute worst types of pedants, including but not limited to
        economists - but clearly that strategy worked, because Ostrom won the
        Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009.
      - >
        If you need any more reasons to like her and her work, try these quotes from Wikipedia:
      - Since the 60s, Ostrom was involved in resource management policy and
        created a research center, which attracted scientists from different
        disciplines from around the world. Working and teaching at her center
        was created on the principle of a workshop, rather than a university
        with lectures and a strict hierarchy.
      - Ostrom studied the interaction of people and ecosystems for many years
        and showed that the use of exhaustible resources by groups of people
        (communities, cooperatives, trusts, trade unions) can be rational and
        prevent depletion of the resource without either state intervention or
        markets with private property.

  - title: The Evolution of Cooperation
    desc:
      - Absolutely fascinating stuff. Robert Axelrod (if the name sounds
        familiar, it might be because his son is David Axelrod, known for
        managing Obama's campaigns) ran an experiment in the 80s. Before we can
        describe it, let's lay some background.
      - The Prisoners' Dilemma is a classic thought experiment which uses game
        theory to argue for disturbing ends. The premise is that two players
        are each chosen to decide whether to "cooperate" or "defect"; the
        game's incentives are set up to encourage defection. Depending on who
        you ask, the game has been claimed to show that cooperation is
        irrational, that individuals will ultimately revert to serving
        self-interest over group interests, that war is rational, and all kinds
        of other absurd and disturbing claims. It is beloved by the types of
        people who claim to be "rational" when they really just mean that
        they're "jerks". It was thought up by some people at the RAND
        Corporation, which is extremely on-brand for them.
      - Now, the Prisoners' Dilemma is a one-shot game. But it gets more
        interesting if you iterate it. Suppose you have two players who play
        the game over and over with each other, and while they don't know the
        other player's move in the current game, they do know what they've
        chosen to do in every previous round of the game. We call this the
        Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma, or IPD.
      - >
        This complicates things: the arguments for the one-shot strategy of
        "always defect" don't clearly apply here, and in fact it can be argued
        that there is no "perfect" strategy for the IPD, in the same way that
        there is no perfect strategy for poker.
      - >
        So Axelrod had an idea: he wrote to everyone he knew who knew how to
        write a program, and he asked all of them to implement strategies for
        the IPD. They would implement their strategies and send them in to him.
        He would then take these and hold a round-robin tournament between them.
      - The results were incredible. The so-called "conventional wisdom"
        strategy of "always-defect" was in fact one of the _worst-performing_
        strategies sent in. The winner was "tit-for-tat", a strategy which
        simply starts out by trying to cooperate, then proceeds to do whatever
        the other player did on their last round. It cooperates as much as
        possible, but gives proportionate responses for betrayal. This, to me,
        is such a simple and beautiful result. It is not "optimal" becaues, as
        discussed, no strategy can be, but within the context of "rational"
        human behavior it was disproportionately high-performing.
      - The book continues with other experiments, such as, what if we have
        initial populations of agents using each strategy, and we adjust the
        populations based on how well they do in the tournament, then run the
        tournament again, etc. He came up with a variety of distinguishing
        qualities for "cooperative" strategies, and identified necessary and
        sufficient conditions for them to survive and thrive even when the
        overwhelmingly dominant strategies are non-cooperative.
      - To me, this provides a serviceable philosophy of life and how to live
        it. Give everyone a chance, see how they respond to that, and go from
        there. If they respond negatively, don't forget that; ideally, cut off
        contact; if that's not possible, don't leave yourself open to them
        again unless they extend an olive branch first.
      - The book goes into much more detail, and it's nearly impossible to
        summarize. Douglas Hofstadter tried, and you can read his take on it in
        Metamagical Themas, or in
        [this PDF excerpt here](https://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/AxelrodComputerTournaments.ExcerptsFromHofstadterSciAmArticle.1983.pdf),
        which comes with my highest recommendations.

    desc: This is a sleeper pick in the Cory Doctorow bibliography. It probably
      wouldn't be in most people's top 3. That said, I liked it. The thing is,
      most of his books feel like vehicles for ideas; this is the only one I've
      read where it felt like the characters came first.

  - title: "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective"

  - title: Deaf Republic

  - title: Something Like an Autobiography
