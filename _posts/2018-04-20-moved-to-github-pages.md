As you can tell if you're reading this post, I've decided to migrate my blog from Blogger to Github Pages.

Blogger's web editing interface is a pain. Their theming tools weren't as flexible as I wanted. I also don't like relying so heavily on a Google-hosted platform.

Github Pages, on the other hand, offers super easy styling and customization. You can even write posts in Markdown, using whatever editor you prefer. Github has proven itself to be a reliable host, too.
