title: Read a Fucking Book

Recently, we started running survival skills workshops for incoming freshmen in the WWU Honors program. In planning follow-up events for this, the question came up of how best to articulate to new students the value of the program. The courseload is very liberal-arts-focused, and so for many students (particularly STEM students) these courses can be expected to overlap very little, if at all, with their major's courses. That's a non-negligible number of extra credits, and there's nothing scarier than a delay in graduation, and so lots of people in the program find themselves questioning, at one point or another, whether the program is worth seeing through to the end. It's our role to try and make the case that it is.

Of course, regardless of obligation, it would be disingenuous of us to argue this point if we did not ourselves wholly believe it. For my part, I am lucky in this regard, because in spite of (because of?) being a Math/CS double major, I'm convinced that the honors classes I've taken have on average been far more valuable than anything I've taken in either of my majors. Ditto for the classes I'm planning on taking.

That's not because I don't like my majors -- far from it, I'm crazy about them. But computer science is close to being treated as a trade skill, and math's "beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture" nourishes only certain parts of the mind. Both majors are fantastic for what they are, but they are not a complete education. Similar things could be said for practically any other major: They all have gaps, and honors gives you the flexibility to try and fill those gaps.

My first, informal attempt at articulating this argument went something like this:

_Why stay with honors? Because we offer things you can't get anywhere else. We have classes you can take as a freshman that're on par with the upper-division classes in specialized majors. You can just be like, "I want to learn about Russian literature this quarter" or "I want to learn about film this quarter" and nobody's going to say, what the fuck, you're a chem major. These kinds of classes are just there, and anyone in the program can take them. If you don't want to be an English major but you want to study great books, we're your best shot. If you want to be in rooms full of clever people talking about Nabokov or Robbe-Grillet or Bely or Dante or any number of great authors you've never heard of, we've got you covered. We've got some of the best professors in the university teaching for us. Great classes, taught by great professors -- what more do you fucking want?_

I stand fully behind that sentiment, in spite of having been expressly forbidden from ever putting it in such terms at official events. (One struggles to imagine why.)

Perhaps it's because this claim, despite being (I maintain) valid in what it says, doesn't go far enough. After all, it's not just that you can study these things if you want to. Yes, you can, and that's amazing. The program offers stellar classes that your average student in an employable major would have no other equivalent for. It's hard to complain about that. But that's not everything. It gets more personal.

It seems fair to claim that just about everyone would say they value self-improvement. I don't think I know anyone who would say they _don't_ think it's important to try to improve oneself. There are uncountably many ways to try to do this, and I don't claim to have any special knowledge of them. Then again, who could, especially given how the very idea of what improvement looks like varies from person to person (for example, I think it'd be nice to be better at making sushi, but I wouldn't prioritize it nearly as highly as, say, [Jiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Ono_(chef)) clearly does). One thing I do feel comfortable saying, though, is that to be well-read is good. Inasmuch as one's lifestyle can support it, one owes it to oneself to make time to read, and preferably to read things one is challenged by.

Ask 20 different people what college is about and you'll get 20 different answers. For my part, I'd opt to abstain from giving a straight answer to the question, but I _will_ say that if you're in college but you aren't here to learn, then you've made some questionable decisions. As in, like, what the fuck are you thinking? You do realize that this isn't free, right? College is for learning, and anyone who's in college ought to be there to learn. If you're here but you don't want to learn, then you're in the wrong place. I'm comfortable saying that. And, if you want to learn, why limit yourself? If you limit what you're willing to learn, you limit the thoughts you're willing to think. Fortune and bureaucracy are already too good at placing limits on people -- don't give them any help. Whatever self-improvement is, I'm pretty sure that's the opposite of it.

Paul ErdÅ‘s once said, when prompted to explain why numbers are beautiful, that

> ...if you can't see why, someone can't tell you. I **know** numbers are beautiful. If they aren't beautiful, nothing is.

When faced with someone who "doesn't really read", or doesn't see what they'd get out of (say) classes charting the course of literature through history, I find my thoughts endlessly returning to this quote. If you don't see the value in studying the best surviving products of literal _millennia_ of cultural development, then there's really nothing I can tell you except that I'm very sorry for you.

On the other hand, if you do see the value here, I have one thing to say, something which I'm sure that in one way or another you already know: Whoever you can learn from, seek them out, go to them, and learn. If learning isn't beautiful, nothing is.
