  - title: The Dispossessed
    desc:
      - If this book had found its way to me a decade or two earlier it would
        have significantly changed my life for the better. Perfect gift for a
        booky kid (or adult).
      - The gist: It's set on an earth-like planet (Urras), and that planet's
        moon (Anarres); the moon has been colonized by utopian anarchists who
        have now spent a couple centuries up there. Their stance towards Urras
        is isolationist. It's a hard but good life, but with limited
        opportunities for academic life, and so Shevek, a brilliant Anarresti
        physicist, decides to take the unprecedented step of leaving the moon
        to study at the universities of Urras; chaos ensues. This narrative is
        interleaved with flashbacks to his earlier life on Anarres.
      - The narrative engages with themes of anarchism, personal and collective
        freedom, capitalism, social control, colonialism, revolutionary
        politics, sexuality, friendship, physics and metaphysics, class
        struggle, environmentalism, and more - all of which I would say it
        navigates maturely and clearheadedly. Somehow, it is never pretentious.
      - Great chaos pick for any politically divided book club.

      - title: Walkaway
        desc: Walkaway substitutes the desert in place of the moon and
          compresses the time-scale a bit, but otherwise it has a lot in common
          with this narrative, and engages with similar themes (in some cases
          taking them much further). Walkaway feels a bit less grounded and
          more explicitly utopian, but if you like one of these books, you'll
          probably like the other.
      - title: The Conquest of Bread
        desc: The Anarresti colonists' political philosophy comes from Odo, who
          politically seems to be sort of a mix of Marx and Kropotkin; her
          formalisms (and cult following) more resemble Marx, but her prose
          style and flavor of anarchism are totally aligned with Kropotkin. So
          if you liked her ideas, why not follow them to the source?
      - title: A Paradise Built in Hell
        desc: The Anarresti's resilience in the face of hardship might seem
          unrealistic, if it weren't for all the evidence that people in
          similar real-world situations actually do behave this way. This book
          is a collection of such evidence: it's a series of case studies of
          disasters, with a focus on how the people caught in them interact.
          Absolutely fascinating and very ideologically aligned.

  - title: Seveneves
    desc:
      - Extraordinarily depressing. The Earth is doomed, we have to go to space
        asap, but it's gonna be really hard and not everyone can make it. Once
        we're in space, we'll have to stay there for a long, long time. The
        survival of humanity is uncertain. The one thing we know for sure is,
        it's gonna take a lot of hard sci-fi to get us through this.
      - Fairly long and discursive, as Neal Stephenson tends to be. This one is
        set over a very long time scale. It plays with a lot of ideas, though I
        can't expand too much on that without giving away plot points. This is
        Stephenson's take on classic sci-fi, writing about spaceships and
        astrophysics and thruster burns and all that nerd shit. If you're into
        that, you'll find a satisfying number of fresh ideas here. If you're
        not into that, you'll probably get bored pretty quickly.
    cf:
      - title: Governing the Commons
        desc: For most of Seveneves, no one has enough. I forget if the phrase
          "tragedy of the commons" is ever actually invoked directly, but the
          idea is constantly hanging in the air. Resources are scarce and hard
          to manage. Governing the Commons is a collection of case studies of
          how this problem has been solved in practice, in the real world. If
          themes of scarcity are interesting to you, you might find this
          interesting, too.
      - title: Anathem
        desc: Another long, discursive Stephenson novel. Stylistically, these
          two novels have a lot in common. They're both full to the seams with
          ideas. In both cases, Stephenson does not seem to care how long it
          takes to work through those ideas, the plot will just have to wait
          until he's had his fun, thank you very much. If (like me) you also
          find that fun, give this novel a try. As a bonus, it's also a lot
          less depressing than Seveneves.

  - title: The Conquest of Bread
    desc:
      - >
        A very famous book. Unfortunately considered cliche to recommend to
        people, but it's good enough that I don't care. You've probably already
        heard of it, and probably have your own opinions about it. Just in case
        you haven't: this book's author, Peter Kropotkin, is one of the
        best-known historic anarchists, and this is his most famous book. It is
        the most accessible book of anarchist political theory that I'm aware
        of.
      - >
        This book is from the 1890s, but for the most part it has aged
        extraordinarily well. Kropotkin was a revolutionary, but he does not
        touch on that here. This book does not deal at all with
        how-we-get-there - rather, in a move that is almost cliche, it picks up
        immediately "after the revolution", asking a simple question: now that
        we're finally reshaping society, what value should we place at its core?
      - >
        His simple answer: "well-being for all". This might sound obvious, but
        he argues compellingly that previous revolutions have failed precisely
        because they failed to uphold this value. In his words, they all forgot
        to account for bread. A revolution can only sustain itself so long on
        ideals alone; it needs to back them up with material improvements in
        quality of life - in other words, it needs to look after well-being for
        all.
      - Well, ok, but what does that mean? This is the question that he spends
        the rest of the book answering, in incredible detail, often with
        empirical figures to back up his arguments.
      - He argues that (using 1890s technology!) we could feed, house, clothe,
        and entertain everyone without asking anyone to work more than five
        hours a day. As an aside, I would <i>love</i> to see someone come up
        with an update to this figure that accounts for modern technology. It
        would not be an easy task, but I'm sure the figure would be striking.
      - My favorite thing about this book is the writing style: It's a very
        casual rhetoric, where many of the lines of argument feel like they
        were workshopped in barroom debates. I have no idea if that's
        historically accurate, but it's endaring - it offers the text a certain
        unpretentious accessibility that a lot of political writing just
        doesn't have.
      - If you have opinions about anarchism, you probably already know this
        book. If you don't, this is the book to read. Also, he talks about
        trains a ton, so if you're the kind of person who likes that, you'll
        have a great time.
    cf:
      - title: Occult Features of Anarchism
        desc: Another of my favorite books on anarchist studies, though more
          focused on history than theory. Kropotkin shows up in it at times.
      - title: Walkaway
        desc: Walkaway is basically Conquest of Bread fanfiction (in a good way).
      - title: The Dispossessed
        desc: Odo, the fictional anarchist political theorist whose ideas are
          woven throughout Dispossessed, would agree with Kropotkin on a whole
          lot of stuff. A very interesting, mature, even-handed exploration of
          how those ideas play out on personal, interpersonal, and societal
          levels.

  - title: White Noise
    desc:
      - I wrote more about this book <a href="/2017/09/12/book-notes.html">here</a>,
        so I'll try to avoid rehashing those notes. In brief, this is DeLillo
        in top form, dealing with themes like information overload, the way
        horrifying realities can become trivialized under scrutiny, the ways
        power structures impose themselves through systems of communication,
        the way those structures become mirrored in interpersonal dynamics, the
        implicit hazards of all of the above, and the ways these themes shape
        our subconscious desires.
      - If you can't tell, I'm having a hard time describing what it's about.
        It gets into big themes. If that all sounds too high-concept for you, I
        don't blame you, but I promise the book itself is surprisingly
        readable. It doesn't hit you over the head with this stuff; rather, it
        just provides an extremely rich text to dig into. DeLillo is the master
        of suggesting this stuff without outright saying it. I admire his
        restraint.
      - This is one of the archetypal novels to write an overambitious college
        paper on; if I was in grad school, I'd give it a go.
    cf:
      - title: Data and Goliath
        desc: Inasmuch as White Noise is a cautionary tale, it is warning us
          about many of the same things that Data and Goliath warns have come
          to pass.
      - title: Obfuscation
        desc: I'll take any chance I can find to recommend this little book,
          but I do think it ties in here, and in an optimistic kind of way.
          In White Noise, reality is becoming increasingly suffused with, well,
          noise, and it is not a good time. In Obfuscation, noise is not
          necessarily a bad thing; rather, it can be problematic or helpful
          depending on context, and we can benefit from knowing when and how to
          use it to our advantage.

  - title: Walkaway
    desc:
      - This was part of a trifecta of books I read (Walkaway - A Paradise
        Built in Hell - The Conquest of Bread) that quite literally reversed my
        outlook on life. I was a very cynical person, and one of the things that
        dragged me out of that particular tar pit was the experience of seeing my
        own ideals reflected back at me through this book. Never before had I
        read something and agreed so thoroughly with it.
      - I've written about it at more length <a href="/2017/09/12/book-notes.html">here</a>.
        Suffice to say I recommend it highly - I think there's something in it
        for just about anyone, at least as long as they're mature enough to not
        be scandalized by a handful of sex scenes.
      - If I were somehow suddenly placed in charge of distributing a
        billionaire's fortune, I would start a foundation dedicated to trying
        to make every piece of sci-fi technology from Walkaway real. That would
        be my plan. No more, no less. Can't happen soon enough.
      - The most quietly radical aspect of this book is the argument it makes
        in favor of having a place to fuck off <i>to</i>. There are whole parts
        of the world that are so unpleasant as to have been abandoned in favor
        of walled cities. This might sound bad, but it leaves room for
        experimentation, which is something we have painfully little of today.
    cf:
      - title: The Conquest of Bread
        desc: The characters of Walkaway don't realize they're anarchists. They
          just kind of do anarchism by accident, because it makes sense at the
          time. I love that. That said, I really wish they would please all
          read a fucking book, and this is the book I'd give them. Then again,
          maybe they wouldn't need it, because they pretty much live it.
      - title: A Paradise Built in Hell
        desc: Walkaway is the story of a utopia-within-a-dystopia. Basically,
          modern life becomes so horrible that the war-scarred, abandoned,
          rubble-strewn desert becomes relatively appealing by comparison. Life
          is hard out there, but the things that make it hard are things you
          can come together against, rather than things that divide you. This
          narrative has so much overlap with the themes of A Paradise Built in
          Hell. That's not a coincidence, either - I actually first heard of
          that book when Doctorow mentioned it during a radio interview for
          Walkaway.
      - title: The Dispossessed
        desc: A very similar book in a lot of ways. There are big differences,
          but the themes they grapple with are similar, although Walkaway's
          treatment of them feels at times less grounded and more hyperbolic.

  - title: Silence on the Wire
    desc:
      - One of the first books on security that I ever read, and, to this day,
        one of my favorites.
      - Ignore every synopsis of this book online. They undersell it. It seems
        ot me like no one was quite sure how to sell this book because no one
        was quite sure what it was or who it was for. The answer is, it's a
        grab bag with a few cool ideas at every level of abstraction in a
        computer system circa 2005. There are a few nominal through-lines
        connecting these ideas, but really it's just a masterclass in
        discursive exposition. As for who it's for, the answer is - hackers. In
        the classic sense where a "hacker" approaches a computer with curiosity
        and tries to do surprising things with it, this is the clearest
        expression of a "hacker mindset" that I've ever seen.
      - In fact, I'll go further: this book is, to me, the high water mark for
        accessible technical writing. Many people would tell you that it's
        possible for technical writing to be either precise or conversational
        but not both at once. Zalewski proves those people wrong. It reminds me
        of how some great teachers can ramble for an hour and somehow manage to
        hit every beat in their lesson plan, while you're so drawn-in that you
        don't even realize you're learning.
      - If you look this book up up online, you can find a preview for the
        first couple chapters and the table of contents. Check it out and see
        if it hooks you. I really recommend it.
    cf:
      - title: Security Engineering
        desc: Really it's hard to compare Silence on the Wire to anything else,
          because I've never read another book like it. That said, part of its
          appeal is how broad its range of topics is, and this is where the
          comparison to Security Engineering comes in - this latter book, while
          somewhat drier, is one of the only books I've seen that has the guts
          to take on a comparably broad scope and actually deliver on it.
