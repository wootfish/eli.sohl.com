        These are so much fun. They're a series of cryptography challenges
        written by some folks who really know their stuff. Sets 1 through 7 are
        available <a href="https://cryptopals.com">here</a>, and you can check
        out Set 8 <a href="https://toadstyle.org/cryptopals/">here</a>. They
        start out easy enough, but the later sets have some genuinely tricky
        problems in them.

        You can check out my solutions
        <a href="https://github.com/wootfish/cryptopals">on Github</a>.
        I've worked through sets 1 through 7 so far, and I plan on taking on
        set 8 soon.

        Back in the day I was very into <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>
        (in fact, I'm still ranked in the 99.4th percentile> on there after
        almost a decade of inactivity), and a lot of what makes Project Euler
        fun can also be found in Cryptopals. Usually, programming is hard in
        tedious ways; this stuff is hard in fun ways. The most challenging parts
        of it are also the most interesting. And it's just so damn satisfying
        when you finally get your solution working for the first time.

        Obsidian is a constraint-based system for graphics programming. It lets
        you define groups of shapes, specify relations between them, style them
        in any way supported by the SVG format, and render them from that
        information alone.

        This is a new project, and it is very much a work in progress, but the
        early results are very promising. You can read about the project
        <a href="{% post_url 2020-04-14-obsidian %}">here</a>, and you can

        Everything you see in my visual sets is generated live. Much of it is
        improvised on the spot.

        <p>
        I shape the images using some MIDI controllers and a lot of custom
        graphics code that I've written from scratch. Last time I checked, the
        program was up to about seven thousand lines of Processing and GLSL.

        I got started on this project in January of 2019 after having a
        transcendental experience in an unexpected place. Ask me at the right
        time and I might tell you the rest of the story :)

        I only write these for books I've really enjoyed. The form, then, is
        less of a review (since you already know what I think) and more of an
        exploration. It's my attempt to share some of what makes these books so
        compelling to me.

        I've been working on this project <a href="{% post_url 2017-02-17-theseus-robust-system-for-preserving %}">since early 2017</a>.
        The goal: to create a robust system for sharing and preserving
        research. This was first conceived as a response to attempts by several
        governments to censor research on climate change.
        </p>

        <p>
        The system consists of two parts: The actual application described
        above - <b>Theseus</b> - and a distributed hash table (DHT) on top of
        which the application is built. In theory, a number of existing DHT
        algorithms could be used, but I'm designing a new one with the working
        name <b>Theseus DHT</b>. I believe this new design can greatly improve
        on today's popular DHTs' defenses against certain categories of attack,
        particularly Sybil attacks.
        </p>

        <p>
        These projects' implementations are not yet complete, but the
        theoretical results achieved so far (the best of which I'm still in the
        process of writing up) are striking.
        </p>

        <p>
        I've written a fair bit on this site about Theseus and Theseus DHT.
        <a href="/tags/theseus.html">Here's a list of those posts</a> (though
        bear in mind that not all of them are up to date).
