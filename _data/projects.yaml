    - These are so much fun. They're a series of cryptography challenges
      written by some folks who really know their stuff. Sets 1 through 7 are
      available <a href="https://cryptopals.com">here</a>, and you can check
      out Set 8 <a href="https://toadstyle.org/cryptopals/">here</a>. They
      start out easy enough, but the later sets have some genuinely tricky
      problems in them.

    - You can check out my solutions <a
      href="https://github.com/wootfish/cryptopals">on Github</a>. I've worked
      through sets 1 through 7 so far, and I plan on taking on set 8 soon.

    - Back in the day I was very into <a
      href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> (in fact, I'm still
      ranked in the 99.4th percentile> on there after almost a decade of
      inactivity), and a lot of what makes Project Euler fun can also be found
      in Cryptopals. Usually, programming is hard in tedious ways; this stuff
      is hard in fun ways. The most challenging parts of it are also the most
      interesting. And it's just so damn satisfying when you finally get your
      solution working for the first time.

- name: obsidian
  details:
    - Obsidian is a constraint-based system for graphics programming. It lets
      you define groups of shapes, specify relations between them, style them
      in any way supported by the SVG format, and render them from that
      information alone.
    - This is a new project, and it is very much a work in progress, but the
      early results are very promising. You can read about the project <a
      href="/2020/04/14/obsidian.html">here</a>, and you can read its source
      code <a href="https://github.com/wootfish/obsidian">here</a>.

    - Everything you see in my visual sets is generated live. Much of it is improvised.
    - I shape the images using some MIDI controllers and a lot of custom
      graphics code that I've written from scratch. Last time I checked, the
      program was up to about seven thousand lines of Processing and GLSL.
    - I got started on this project in January of 2019 after a transcendental
      experience in an unexpected place.

- name: book notes
  details:
    - You can find a collection of these posts <a href="/tags/book-notes.html">here</a>.
    - I only write these for books I've really enjoyed. The form, then, is less
      of a review (since you already know what I think) and more of an
      exploration. It's my attempt to share some of what makes these books so
      compelling to me.

    - <i>This project is currently paused; see <a href="https://eli.sohl.com/2020/04/26/pressing-pause-on-theseus.html">this post</a> for details.</i>

      I've been working on this project <a
      href="/2017/02/17/theseus-robust-system-for-preserving.html"> since early
      2017</a>. The goal: to create a robust system for sharing and preserving
      research. This was first conceived as a response to attempts
      by several governments to censor research on climate change.
    - >
      The system consists of two parts: The actual application described
      above - <b>Theseus</b> - and a distributed hash table (DHT) on top of
      which the application is built. In theory, a number of existing DHT
      algorithms could be used, but I'm designing a new one with the working
      name <b>Theseus DHT</b>. I believe this new design can greatly improve
      on today's popular DHTs' defenses against certain categories of attack,
      particularly Sybil attacks.
    - These projects' implementations are not yet complete, but the theoretical
      results achieved so far are striking.
    - I've written a fair bit on this site about Theseus and Theseus DHT. <a
      href="/tags/theseus.html">Here's a list of those posts</a> (though bear
      in mind that not all of them are up to date).
