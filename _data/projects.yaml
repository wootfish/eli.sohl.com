- name: cryptopals guided tour
  details:
    - The Cryptopals challenges are a series of cryptography problem sets. I
      have a high opinion of these, and <a href="https://github.com/wootfish/cryptopals">wrote a solution set</a>
      prior to joining NCC Group's Cryptography Services team (which currently
      maintains the challenges).

    - I've had the privilege, while working on this team, of creating a
      companion piece to these challenges, which I'm calling the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWvDpnCcem1P6i8pZm2x7KHp5iaxwrK_P">Cryptopals Guided Tour</a>.
      You can read my introduction to the series <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/12/10/announcing-ncc-groups-cryptopals-guided-tour/">here</a>.

      This series was inspired by my experience helping a couple people work
      through the challenges. As much as I enjoyed this, I realized two
      things: first, it's really fun, and second, it's really time-consuming. To
      save time, I tried to steer them towards answering their own questions
      through research, but with cryptography being the esoteric field that it
      is, often the primary sources they were looking for didn't exist or
      weren't written to be accessible to students. Seeing this, I chose to
      take matters into my own hands and create a series where I just sit down
      and explain, as clearly as I can, everything I'd want to convey if I were
      helping someone with the problem sets in person.

    - The problems are treated as jumping-off points for discursive discussions
      with as many tangents, connections, suggested readings, as I can pack in.
      The goal is not just to reach the finish line as fast as possible, but to
      take a leisurely stroll in that direction and see some sights along the
      way. I'm hoping this will make the videos interesting even to people who
      have already solved the problems.

    - Starting with the second problem set, I've also started using <a href="https://www.manim.community/">manim</a>
      to generate custom illustrations of the concepts at play in each
      challenge. It's not really built for computer science, so to support this
      project I've had to develop a custom plugin which I'm calling cranim; this will be released Soon(TM).

      Ironically, this project has itself proven to be very time-consuming; in
      fact, it has devoured much of my free time for several years running.
      This is in part because I've had to teach myself each step in the
      process, some of which, like audio engineering, manually cleaning
      recordings, video editing, and rendering animations, are nontrivial
      (luckily, they're also fun).

    - So far, the reception has been overwhelmingly positive (it spent a day in
      the top ten on Hacker News!), and I am planning to continue the series
      for as long as my employer continues supporting it.

    - I've been collaborating with my good friends in Fuzzy Math, developing
      visual sets for their live shows. You can see an example above.
    - I run the lights off of a couple MIDI controllers which feed into a
      custom graphics framework I've written from scratch in Processing and
      GLSL.
    - Everything you see in my visual sets is generated live. It's different
      every time, and most of it is improvised.

- name: book notes
  details:
    - You can find a collection of these posts <a href="/tags/book-notes.html">here</a>.
    - I only write these for books I've really enjoyed. The form, then, is less
      of a review (since you already know what I think) and more of an
      exploration. It's my attempt to share some of what makes these books so
      compelling to me.

- name: theseus
  details:
    - <i>This project is currently paused; see <a href="https://eli.sohl.com/2020/04/26/pressing-pause-on-theseus.html">this post</a> for details.</i>
    - >
      I've been working on this project <a
      href="/2017/02/17/theseus-robust-system-for-preserving.html"> since early
      2017</a>. The goal: to create a robust system for sharing and preserving
      research. This was first conceived as a response to attempts
      by several governments to censor research on climate change.
    - >
      The system consists of two parts: The actual application described
      above - <b>Theseus</b> - and a distributed hash table (DHT) on top of
      which the application is built. In theory, a number of existing DHT
      algorithms could be used, but I'm designing a new one with the working
      name <b>Theseus DHT</b>. I believe this new design can greatly improve
      on today's popular DHTs' defenses against certain categories of attack,
      particularly Sybil attacks.
    - These projects' implementations are not yet complete, but the theoretical
      results achieved so far are striking.
    - I've written a fair bit on this site about Theseus and Theseus DHT. <a
      href="/tags/theseus.html">Here's a list of those posts</a> (though bear
      in mind that not all of them are up to date).

- name: obsidian
  details:
    - Obsidian is a constraint-based system for graphics programming. Backed by
      Z3, It lets you define groups of shapes, specify relations between them,
      style them in any way supported by the SVG format, and render them from
      that information alone.
    - You can read about the project <a href="/2020/04/14/obsidian.html">here</a>,
      and you can read its source code <a href="https://github.com/wootfish/obsidian">here</a>.
    - To be honest, the project is currently in a half-broken state - I added
      support for animations, and got just far enough to generate the content
      in <a href="/2020/04/20/wangs-attack-1.html">the first part of my writeup of Wang's Attack</a>,
      but this broke some stuff and I haven't picked up the pieces yet.
    - I feel that this project is <i>cool</i>, and I'm proud of it, but
      practically speaking I'm not sure it does much that I couldn't also do
      with <a href="https://www.manim.community/">Manim</a> and the <a href="manim-mobject-svg">manim-mobject-svg</a>
      plugin (neither of which were made by me, just to be clear - but they're
      what I would use today, which is why I haven't felt the need to fix this
      tool yet).

- name: note server
  details:
    - I have an unconventional system for taking notes, and I'm a bit proud of
      it.
    - Most of my notes start out as voice notes on a dedicated handheld
      recorder. This plugs into a central server over USB; whenever the
      recorder is plugged in, recordings are automatically moved off of it.
      This is also how the recorder recharges.
    - Once transferred, recordings are automatically encrypted and these
      encrypted copies are backed up to the cloud. The server, which has lots
      of cores and lots of RAM, also runs an optimized implementation of
      OpenAI's Whisper text-to-speech model, which automatically transcribes
      every recording.
    - These transcriptions are automatically fed into my text-based note taking
      system, which is built around ssh and Vim with the vim-notes plugin.
    - I'm planning on writing a couple blog posts, one on the TTS stuff and one
      on the vim-notes stuff, and will update this section once they're
      finished.

- name: project euler
  details:
    - Project Euler is a bafflingly extensive set of problems situated in the
      overlap of math and computer science. Back in high school I was really
      into these, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/profile/wootfish.png">as you
      can see</a>, and despite having barely touched them in the last decade
      I'm still ranked in the 99.3rd percentile.
    - Unlike Cryptopals, Project Euler strongly discourages people from sharing
      their solutions, as I think they should. That said, everyone who works on
      these problem sets in any serious way will end up building up an
      extensive toolkit, and I don't see anything wrong with sharing those. One
      of these days I'll get around to sharing mine; watch this space.
